# Duplicate Term ID Assignment Fix

## Problem Description

A code duplication issue was identified in the `improved_query_approach.py` file where the `term_id` variable was being assigned twice in both the `query_ttm_data()` and `query_dissection_data()` functions. This redundancy occurred when handling date strings in the period parameter.

The duplicate assignment looked like this:

```python
# First assignment
term_id = db.get_term_id(period_term, company_id)

# ... some code ...

# Duplicate assignment with the same values
term_id = db.get_term_id(period_term, company_id)
```

This duplication could lead to:

1. Unnecessary database calls to retrieve the same `term_id` value twice
2. Potential confusion during code maintenance
3. Slight performance degradation due to redundant operations

## Root Cause Analysis

The duplication likely occurred during code refactoring or when adding additional functionality to handle different period formats. The developer may have added the second assignment without realizing that the variable was already being set earlier in the function.

The issue was present in both the `query_ttm_data()` and `query_dissection_data()` functions, suggesting a systematic pattern rather than an isolated mistake.

## Solution Implementation

The fix involved:

1. Identifying all instances of duplicate `term_id` assignments in the codebase
2. Removing the redundant assignments while ensuring the variable is still properly initialized
3. Verifying that the behavior remains unchanged after the fix

A regex-based approach was used to systematically identify and remove the duplicates while maintaining the single necessary assignment.

### Implementation Details

The fix was implemented in a new file called `fixed_improved_query_approach.py`, which contains the corrected version of the code. The original file was preserved for reference.

An application script `apply_fix.py` was also created to automate the fix process, which:

1. Reads the original file
2. Identifies and removes duplicate `term_id` assignments
3. Writes the corrected code to the new file
4. Performs verification checks to ensure the fix was applied correctly

## Testing and Verification

The fix was verified using several test scripts:

1. `test_fix.py` - Validates that the duplicate assignments were correctly removed
2. `test_dissection_metrics.py` - Ensures that dissection metrics queries still work correctly

During testing, some unrelated failures were observed for metrics like "QoQ Revenue Growth" due to database configuration issues, but these were not related to the duplicate `term_id` fix.

## Code Changes

Here's an example of the code before and after the fix:

### Before Fix

```python
def query_ttm_data(self, company_name, metric_name, period, consolidation_type="Unconsolidated"):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    if isinstance(period, str):
        period_end = self._format_date(period)
        period_term = self._get_period_term(period_end)
        term_id = self.get_term_id(period_term, company_id)
        
        # ... some code ...
        
        # Duplicate assignment
        term_id = self.get_term_id(period_term, company_id)
    
    # ... rest of the function ...
```

### After Fix

```python
def query_ttm_data(self, company_name, metric_name, period, consolidation_type="Unconsolidated"):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    if isinstance(period, str):
        period_end = self._format_date(period)
        period_term = self._get_period_term(period_end)
        term_id = self.get_term_id(period_term, company_id)
        
        # ... some code ...
        
        # Duplicate assignment removed
    
    # ... rest of the function ...
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Code Clarity**: Removing redundant code makes the functions easier to understand and maintain
2. **Reduced Database Calls**: Eliminates unnecessary calls to `get_term_id()`, potentially improving performance
3. **Consistent Variable Usage**: Ensures that `term_id` is assigned only once, reducing potential confusion
